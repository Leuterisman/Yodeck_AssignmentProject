**Prerequisites:**

Before you can run the tests, ensure that the following are installed on your machine:

Node.js: Version 16 or above.
Playwright: The Playwright testing framework.
TypeScript: Required to work with TypeScript-based tests.

**Installation:**

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Inside the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

`npm install`

2. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   To use Playwright for browser automation, you need to install the necessary browser binaries. Run the following command to install them:

`npx playwright install`

**Usage:**

1. **Running the Tests**
   You can run the Playwright tests using the following command (This will execute all the tests inside the tests folder):

`npx playwright test`

2. **Running Specific Test Files**
   If you want to run a specific test file, use the following command:

Example:
`npx playwright test tests/stock-images.spec.ts`

3. **Running Tests in Specific Browsers**
   **A.** If you want to run tests in a specific browser, use:

Example:
`npx playwright test --project=chromium`

**B.** If you want to run a specific test file in Chromium, use the following command:

Example:
`npx playwright test tests/email-login.spec.ts --project=chromium`

**C.** If you want to run a specific test case within a test file, use the -g or --grep option with the name of the test case:

Example:
`npx playwright test tests/email-login.spec.ts -g "Login with valid credentials" --project=chromium`

4. **Headless and Headful Mode**
   Playwright runs tests in headless mode by default, meaning the browser runs without a UI. To run the tests in headful mode (with a visible browser window), add the --headed flag:

`npx playwright test --headed`

5. **Running Tests with Debugging Enabled**
   If you want to debug a specific test or see more detailed logs, you can use (This will pause the tests at the point of failure, allowing you to inspect the browser's state):

`npx playwright test --debug`
